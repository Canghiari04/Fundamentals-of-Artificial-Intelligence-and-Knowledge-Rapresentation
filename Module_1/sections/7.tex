\textbf{Automated planning} is an important problem solving activity, which consists in summerizing a sequence of actions performed by an agent that leads from an initial
state to a given target state. \vspace{3.5pt}

For humans this type of tasks are very easy to perform, but for computers is one of the most difficult. Additionally, we need a set of symbols that allow us to describe
every single action taken, that cannot be \textbf{natural language}. Generally, natural language should be avoided as it is the primary cause of ambiguity. \vspace{3.5pt}

The foundations about automated planning are given by:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Initial state.
    \item State to achieve, also called goal state.
    \item Set of actions that the agent can perform. These actions should not be macro-actions or actions that our agent cannot carry out.
\end{enumerate} \vspace{3.5pt}

Despite the goal consists to reach a target state, we focus on the steps necessary that could bring us from the initial state to the final one. Before moving on, we have to
define some basic concepts about automated planning. 
\begin{definition}
    An \textbf{automated planner} is an intelligent agent that operates in a certain domain, described by:
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
        \item A representation of the initial state.
        \item A representation of the goal state.
        \item A formal description of the executable actions.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Domain theory} defines a formal description about all the executable actions. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Each action is identified by a name\footnote{So many times we can perform the same actions with different variables, therefore can be useful call them with a \textbf{class name}.} and formalized through \textbf{pre-conditions} and \textbf{post-conditions}, which are expressed as follows:
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
        \item Pre-conditions are the conditions which \textbf{must hold} to ensure that the action can be executed.
        \item Post-conditions represent the \textbf{effects} of the action in the environment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Let's consider a trivial example just to fix these concepts.
\begin{example}
    i.e. Block world. \vspace{3.5pt}

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{img/img15.png}
    \end{center} \vspace{3.5pt}

    The executable actions are:
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
        \item \textbf{Stack(x,y)} \\ Pre-conditions: holding(x), clear(y) \\ Post-conditions: handempty, clear(x), on(x,y)
        \item \textbf{Unstack(x,y)} \\ Pre-conditions: handempty, clear(x), on(x,y) \\ Post-conditions: holding(x), clear(y)
        \item \textbf{Pick-up(x)}\footnote{Different from \textbf{Stack}, \textbf{Pick-up} grabs a block on the table that it is not on any other block.} \\ Pre-conditions: handempty, ontable(x), clear(x) \\ Post-conditions: holding(x)
        \item \textbf{Put-down(x)} \\ Pre-conditions: holding(x) \\ Post-conditions: ontable(x), clear(x), handempty
    \end{enumerate} \vspace{3.5pt}

    From a logic point of view, all the inner functions are \textbf{predicates}, by these properties we can describe all the possible situations. As the example 
    shows, predicates are generally used for pre-conditions and post-conditions of the actions.
\end{example}

When an action is performed all the pre-conditions become false, all the post-conditions become true and all the untouched conditions should be unchanged. In logic this
is called \textbf{frame problem}; everything that is untouched by an action should be unchanged, moved to the next state. \vspace{3.5pt}

Our goal is to determine a resolution process, a sequence of actions that leads us to the final state. This is achieved by an intelligent agent that implements an algorithm. As usual,
the embedding algorithm has some features, as:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
    \item \textbf{Completeness}. \\ A planner or an agent is \textbf{complete} if it always finds a plan when it exists.
    \item \textbf{Correctness}. \\ A planner or an agent is \textbf{correct} when the solution found leads from the initial state to the goal.
\end{itemize}

In addition, it's possible to divide planners according to the type of strategies used for the planning, which are:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
    \item \textbf{Offline planners}. \\ Offline planners, also called \textbf{generative planners}, work on representations of the world, they draw up plans and then computed them.
    \item \textbf{Online planners}. \\ Online planners, also named \textbf{reactive planners}, work in the world, doing changes in the current environment. 
\end{itemize}
The main difference between these strategies is that plans generated by generative agents are purely \textbf{abstract}; they do not change the current environment. This characteristic means 
that the plan design process can be directly seen as a \textbf{search process}; we may find out a list of actions or a sequence of steps that allow us to reach the final goal\footnote{They are, in a such way, both \textbf{constructive algorithms}.}. \vspace{3.5pt}

The \textbf{execution} phase involves the implementation of the plan. This phase is typically characterized by two main attributes:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
    \item \textbf{Irreversibility}. \\ Once a state transition is made, it is generally not backtrackable, making the execution non-reversible.
    \item \textbf{Non-deterministic}. \\ Actions are performed under real-world uncertainty, meaning the outcome may not be entirely predictable and unexpected behaviors might occur.
\end{itemize} \vspace{3.5pt}

We will look at the following planning strategies:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
    \item Planning as search.
    \item Linear planning.
    \item Deductive planning.
    \item Nonlinear planning - Partial Order Planning (POP).
    \item Hierarchical planning.
    \item Conditional planning.
    \item Graph-based planning.
\end{itemize}
