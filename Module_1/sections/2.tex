This chapter covers several search strategies that come under the heading of \textbf{non-informed strategies}. The term \textit{non-informed} means that the strategies have no 
additional knowledge about the domain; all they can do is generate successors and distinguish a goal state from a non-goal state. We introduce four non-informed search strategies:
\begin{itemize}
    \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
    \item BFS.
    \item DFS.
    \item DFS with limited depth.
    \item Iterative deepening.
\end{itemize}
