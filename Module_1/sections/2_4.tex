As we said, depth-first search is not complete: the algorithm could enter in infinite cycles. This problem can be avoided introducing some changes to the original algorithm, such as
a predetermined depth limit $l$. All the nodes at depth $l$ are treated as leaves node, they have no successors. This search strategy is called \textbf{depth-limit search}.
Unfortunately, even though it solves the problem of infinite cycles, it introduces another source of \textbf{no-completeness}; if we choose a limit $l < d$, the shallowest goal-node
may not be achieved. Depth-limited search will also be \textbf{non-optimal} if we choose $l > d$. \vspace{3.5pt}

It's time complexity is exponential, $O(b^l)$, and its space complexity is linear, $O(bl)$\footnote{Depth-first search can be viewed as a special case of depth-limit search with $l=\infty$}.
