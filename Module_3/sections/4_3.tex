The complexity of exact inference depends strictly on the structure of the network. The burglary network belongs to the family of networks in which there is at most one path
between any couple of nodes. These are called \textbf{polytrees}, and they have a particularly nice property: the complexity of exact inference in polytrees is linear in the size
of the network.
\begin{definition}[title={Theorem}]
    The complexity of variable elimination is $O(d^kn)$ if the network is a \textbf{polytrees} one, in other words any couple of nodes are connected by at most one path.
\end{definition}
If the network is not a polytrees one, variable elimination can have exponential complexity in the worst case; generally named as \textbf{NP-hard} problem.
